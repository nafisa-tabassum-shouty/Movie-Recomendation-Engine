In those situations, in which a supplier defaults prior to providing services you may pursue any recourse against the supplier for a refund, as permitted by law or statute.

Except as expressly stated herein, FEBD Ltd. assumes no responsibility for actions relating to travel services beyond the control of FEBD Ltd. or its employees. FEBD Ltd. is not responsible or liable for any act, error, omission, injury, loss, accident, damage, delay, nonperformance, irregularity, or any consequence thereof, which may be occasioned through neglect, or default or any other act or inaction of any Travel Supplier.
